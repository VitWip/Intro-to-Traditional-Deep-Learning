The following code attempts to create a model that predicts the future values ​​of the company Petrobras, using the closing values ​​with a lag of 5 days, the average and the extender division of the last 10 days. We can use RNN and LSTM models, because both have a temporal dimension, but after testing it was identified that the LSTM model has a greater tendency to promote overfitting for this specific group of data due to its complexity, so RNN was used in the project.
